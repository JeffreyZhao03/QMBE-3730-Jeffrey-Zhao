##For this task, you are required to analyze the data for trends, 
##missing values, data types, shape etc. and upload your scripts to GitHub.

##One trend I see from the data is that as credit age goes higher the avg_bal_cards goes higher. This may be because 
##as someone gets older the amount they spend increases. They both seem to be positively correlated. 
##Another trend I see is rep_income seems to go up the more educated a person is. There seems to be a trend,
##where people with higher level of education have a higher income. Some missing values are from these columns
##pct_card_over_50_uti and rep_income. Rep_income could be empty, because people may not know how much they make a year.
##The data types are mostly numerical. Some other data types are text.
